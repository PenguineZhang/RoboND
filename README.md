## Project: Search and Sample Return
### Project Objective
This project is to navigate the Rover autonomously to explore a simulated environment and locate samples.

The simulation and the autonomy development are inspired by the [NASA sample return challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html)
